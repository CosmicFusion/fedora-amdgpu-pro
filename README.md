# fedora-amdgpu-pro
A repository that provides the proprietary driver for fedora without having to deal with hassle of getting RHEL repo to work , and it has 32 bit libraries.

The end goal of this repository is to hand it over to glourious eggroll , so he can use it to supply AMD proprietary to nobara/fedora users
